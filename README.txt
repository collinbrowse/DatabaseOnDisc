This is a project I had to do for my Database Systems class (cs345)
We were instructed to implement CRUD functionality for a table that
was studied extensively in class, on the disk. The suppliers table has 5 attributes:
shipment_number, name, status and city. The program can now successfully
insert(), delete() and selectAll(), all while keeping track of the data
in a .dat file.
